# Tech challenge

> QED frontend tech challenge

## Overview

Using the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) and [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API), build an application that will display the forecast for the current location. The main page should display the 7 days of the week (Mon-Sun), along with the forecasted temperature.

## Tech Stack

As long as the solution is built using web technologies, you can use any tools you like (at QED, we mostly use `React` with `styled-components`).

## Browser Support

You should test your work in the latest version of Chrome. If you use any features that are not supported by common browsers or IE 11, you should mention these features and how you would provide a suitable fallback experience if your code does not do so already.

## Dependencies

Please use `npm` for dependency management.

You can use any 3rd-party libraries as necessary or desired, but we prefer the use of minimal dependencies.

## Coding Standard

Please return to us your solution, including all the files you would like to share within 5 working days.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

We hope you enjoy this and happy coding!
