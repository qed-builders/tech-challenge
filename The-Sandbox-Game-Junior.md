## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site.
- Edit the input value.
- Submit the form.

- You will get extra points for _accessibility_.
- You will get extra points for _responsive design_.
- You will get extra points for using `SCSS` or `tailwind`.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. A JPG file is provided for you to work with.
The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/design/assets` folder.
This design uses the `font-family` [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).
