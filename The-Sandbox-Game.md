> Sandbox game frontend tech challenge

## Overview

[The Doggies](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc7df86762ba83f2a6197e1ff9bb40ae0f696b9e6) is one of the most popular The Sandbox Game NFT collection created on the Ethereum Network.

For this challenge you will create a simple UI that will be able to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain, using `Web3.js` and the `Vue2` (or `Nuxt`) library.
This UI will allow the user to type in a Doggie ID, and will display information about that Doggie.

> Given the address for the The Doggies Smart Contract:
> `0xc7df86762ba83f2a6197e1ff9bb40ae0f696b9e6` Find its _ABI_ (You
> will need it to complete the challenge).

## Requirements

Build a simple UI where the user can type in an ID and display the following information about a Doggie:

1. Name
2. Owner
3. Description
4. Thumbnail
5. List of traits

Write a unit test that you consider relevant, using the unit test framework of your preference. It should run using `npm run test`.
Feel free to customize the styles as you wish or use any extra libraries that you need.

- You will get extra points if you create a _"Search random Doggie"_ button.
- You will get extra points for _design_.
- You will get extra points for using `SCSS`+`BEM`.
